## CA01: Exploratory Data Analysis - House Price Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics \
such as mean, standard deviation, and count, so on, often with visua methods. \
Itâ€™s where the researcher takes a birdâ€™s eye view of the data and tries to make some sense of it. \
Itâ€™s often the first step in data analysis, implemented before any formal statistical techniques are applied.

## CA02: Spam eMail Detection using Naive Bayes Classification Algorithm
This exercise will train the model with set of emails labelled as either from Spam or Not Spam. \
There are 702 emails equally divided into spam and non spam category. \
Next, the model will be tested on 260 emails. The category of this emails is going to be predict \
by the model and compare the accuracy with the correct classification. 

## CA03: Decision Tree Algorithm
The dataset is obtained from the Census Bureau and represents salaries of people along with \
seven demographic variables. The goal is to build a Decision Tree Classifier Model to understand \
and visualise the dataset. 2 target classes will be aimmed in this model \
the income class of ('>50K' and '<=50K') [ Labels: 1, 0 ] . 

## CA04: Ensemble Models
The dataset is obtained from the Census Bureau and represents salaries of people along with \
seven demographic variables. The goal is to build Ensemble Models to find the best number of \
estimators, one of the key hyper-parameters, by creating line graphs.
