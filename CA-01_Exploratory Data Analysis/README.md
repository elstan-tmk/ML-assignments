# CA01: Exploratory Data Analysis - House Price Analysis <br>

The dataset is from <b> github.com/ArinB/MSBA-CA-Data/CA01</b>

Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach analyzing data sets to summarize their main
characteristics such as mean, standard deviation, and count, so on, often with visual
methods. It’s where the researcher takes a bird’s eye view of the data and tries to make
some sense of it. It’s often the first step in data analysis, implemented before any formal
statistical techniques are applied.<br>

# House Price Dataset
As always, learning by doing is the best practice to understand deeper. So now, we are
going to make our hands dirt by analyzing House Price Dataset.
Once the dataset is made “analytics ready”, you can use this dataset for Hour Price
Prediction using various algorithms later. But for now you first need to analyze the
structure, domain, and contents of it thoroughly. <br>

# Dataset: Basic Info <br>

## What is it about?<br>

This data provides values of various features that “might” be predictive of house prices.
In other words, if a ML model is developed using this dataset, potentially such a model
can be used to determine the “listing price” of a property that the owners are planning to
sell.<br>

## What information it has? <br>

The dataset comes with the following files. You can view them at:
github.com/ArinB/MSBA-CA-Data/CA01
- Data Description text file
- house-price-train.csv
- house-price-test.csv
<br>
However, for this assignment you will use only house-price-train.csv for the purpose of
EDA and Data Cleaning. The goal is to make the training data ready for building a ML
Model. The model building is not part of this assignment. If and when you would build a
ML model to predict house prices, you will have to do the same EDA+Data Cleaning for
the house-price-test.csv as well. But for this assignment, just focus on the house-pricetrain.
